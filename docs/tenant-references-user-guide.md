## For Tenants: Managing Your References

### Overview
References are an important part of your rental prequalification. They give landlords confidence before committing to tours or paperwork. The RentCard platform allows you to manage your references efficiently and securely.

### Adding a New Reference
1. Navigate to the **References** tab in your tenant dashboard.
2. Click the **+ Add Reference** button.
3. Fill in the required information:
   - **Name**: Full name of your reference
   - **Relationship**: Select the type of relationship (e.g., Previous Landlord, Employer, Personal)
   - **Email**: Valid email address for verification
   - **Phone**: Contact phone number
   - **Notes** (optional): Any additional information about this reference
4. Click **Save** to add the reference to your profile.

### Managing Existing References
- **View**: All your references are displayed as cards on the References page.
- **Edit**: Click the menu (three dots) on a reference card and select "Edit" to update information.
- **Delete**: Click the menu on a reference card and select "Delete" to remove a reference.
- **Filter**: Use the filter dropdown to view specific types of references or verification status.

### Sending Verification Requests
1. For each reference, click the menu (three dots) and select "Send Verification Email".
2. The system will send an email to your reference with a secure verification link.
3. The verification status will be updated once your reference completes the verification.

### Understanding Verification Status
- **Pending**: The reference has been added but not yet verified.

### Best Practices
- Always inform your references before adding them to your profile.
- Ensure email addresses are correct to avoid verification delays.
- Add a variety of reference types for a more comprehensive profile.
- Follow up with references who haven't completed verification.
